# Churn Prediction Model
Churn prediction models are crucial for companies to identify which customers might soon leave. It is one of the best ways to leverage your data since this insight allows businesses to implement targeted retention strategies effectively.

In this project, I built a model using PySpark and Python. Building these models requires expertise in Python, including skills in data manipulation, machine learning, and statistical analysis to interpret customer data and predict behaviors. This proactive approach helps in improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

This is an educational example. The dataset has been anonymized. It shows information on 7,043 clients from a communication company.
